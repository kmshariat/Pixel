# Random Simulation
This is a repository which I don't find any of practical use. Just an idea came while working with random dataset. This code can create 

<ul>
  <li>An image of m*n shape image. Each pixel is assigned with a statistical random value from 0 to 255 </li>
  <li>A video in any folder in your local pc. It uses images stored in your pc as frames. Thus creating the simulation of the random images.</li>
</ul>
